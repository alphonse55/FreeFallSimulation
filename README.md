# GravitySimulator
This program written in Python simulates free fall by plotting a graph of height vs time with matplotlib.
It works in the CLI and asks the user for a Planet to simulate, the initial height, the initial speed (positive points to the top, negative to the bottom), the time to simulate and the interval of time (dt) between two points.
